> Hi, there! I'm Zhixu and very glad you visit my personal website. I'm currently a master student at the University of Helsinki. My major is language technology/natural language processing. I would like to share my study notes about NLP and Finnish learning here. Please feel free to look around. 

My had a number of math & programming courses in my undergraduate study, including Calculus, Linear algebra, Probabilities & Statistics, Applied Stochastic Process, Mathematical modelling, Econometrics, Machine learning and data mining, and Python & Big data.
I also list some master-level courses that I took at UH:
1. [_Computational syntax_](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-134683561-2020-08-01/LDA-T303/Computational_syntax), introduced syntactic konwledge and different algorithms for parsing. For example, HMM(Hidden Markov Model) and CFG(Context Free Grammar).
2. [_Computational semantics_](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-134683564-2020-08-01/LDA-T304/Computational_semantics), discussed compositional semantics and distributional semantics. Also, Word2vec, Singular Value Decomposition and disambiguiation.
3. [_Introduction to deep learning_](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-134683616-2020-08-01/LDA-T308/Introduction_to_deep_learning), introduced FFNN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Seq2Seq, Transformers. Also include regularization, optimization.
4. [_Introduction to Natural Language Processing_](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-118243935-2020-08-01/LDA-T501/Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing), explained how to do morphological analysis, word sense disambiguation, POS/Sequence labeling.
