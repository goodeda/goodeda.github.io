I used to enter the password when pushing file to Github or connecting to remote server. I always feel this step redundant and recently came to konw that ssh is a good solution. I want to record these steps in case of need later.

## SSH FOR GIT PUSH
1. Running the following command: 
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
<keep clicking 'Enter' if system asks you for actions>
``` 
You can also add `-C "your_email@example.com"` at the end of `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to make a copy of the ssh-key by email.
2. Check your ~/.ssh folder and there is a `id_rsa.pub`
3. Add the key to github account.
4. Change to the git repo folder and run: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git`, here the `origin` could also be `master`.
5. Then try `git push` and this time it shouldn't require you to enter password anymore.

## Remote Server
1. If you already have a key, then run `ssh-copy-id <your server address>`
2. If you don't have, you can just follow the step 1&2 for github and do the above step. 
3. You can directly log in when next time you try to connect server with `ssh <server>`.
