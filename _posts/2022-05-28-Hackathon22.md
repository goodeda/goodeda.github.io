### Project Background
The project is a topic of [Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon 2022](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/helsinki-digital-humanities-hackathon-2022-dhh22).The theme is [Network of Parlamint](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/dhh22-hackathon/dhh22-themes). The data include national parliament speeches of 17 european countries. We eventually selected and focus on the Spanish term 12, UK term 57, Slovenian term 7 datasets.

### Research question
1. How is the speeches of MPs and mentions of them are related to the power?
2. Is there power distribution  between male and female speeches, regarding different topics.

### My work

### Final output
Our team produced an excellent academic poster. Here is the picture.
